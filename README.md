# Intro

This is the repo for Feed Reader Testing Project for the Front End ND program. I learned about Jasmine which was cool and wrote a bunch of tests (see below) for given functionalities. Although not employed throughout this project, I also became familiar with Test Driven Development.

# How to run?

Simply clone the repository and run the `index.html` file on web browser of your choosing.

# What to look out for?

- You might see page update itself a few times. This because of the tests running on the background.
- The results of the tests are shown at the bottom of the page within the jasmine html reporter.
- All changes ever made to complete this project was done on a single file, namely `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`. Look at the corresponding comments within the TODO sections in this file in order to make sense of individual implementations.
